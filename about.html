                    <h3 class="bioGreeting">Hi Everyone,</h3>  
                    <p class="bioGraph">My name is Kathryn and I am a Full Stack Developer. I have a 
                        passion for learning and I'm in the Full Stack Flex program through Thinkful. I fell 
                        in love with coding in high school and recently decided to pursue it 
                        full-time. I have predominantly worked with HTML and CSS.  During my 
                        undergraduate career I took several semesters of computer science courses 
                        focusing on Java and Python. Some of my favorite things to work on are 
                        algorithm development and complex data structures. I am currently learning 
                        JavaScript and JQuery.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bioGraph">My bachelor's degree is in biology with a focus on cell and molecular
                        biology. I currently work in a research lab in the Milwaukee area. I the research I have 
                        assisted with I have always loved pulling in mathematical and computer models 
                        which is how I was able to incorporate computer science courses into my schedule. 
                    </p>    
                    <p class="bioGraph">In my spare time I love knitting and all things fiber related. I also
                        enjoy blogging, binging podcasts, tennis and going snowboarding.
                    </p>
